## Main Page
- Input "Enter a word"
- The main page is the only page with unlimited scrolling, zooming, and moving around (spatial navigation)
- Unconventional searching: 
    - No input bar anywhere
    - Has to click on the screen to start typing a word
    - Can enter a word anywhere on the screen, wherever clicked on
    - Hit "Enter" on keyboard to search
- Upon Entering a word:
    - As you click Enter with a word, small tabs fade into the same page and get placed around the entered word
    - These tabs contain the information about the word
    - The tabs are arranged in a justified way with no overlapping and are placed closer and equidistant to the entered word
    - One tab may contain historical usage with a small relevant image displayed, and other tabs with etymology, meaning, synonyms, antonyms, and other related information.
    - These tabs when clicked on would expand to show more information, and when clicked again would collapse back to the small tab size
- Future Enhancements:
    - Zooming: Implement zoom functionality using the mouse wheel or buttons.
    - Dynamic Content: Add dynamic content like images, text, or interactive elements that also move with the canvas.
    - Performance Optimization: For larger canvases or more complex content, consider using requestAnimationFrame for smoother performance.
